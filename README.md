# Text_Analyzer_Program
A program written in Python that analyzes the text of a file.

I created a program that shows the use of functions, exception handling, and if-statements in Python. This program will analyze a text file and give the user the choice to either view the text, see the number of times a character appears in the text, count the total words, or show the percentage of each letter in the file.
